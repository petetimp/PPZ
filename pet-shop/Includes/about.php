		<p id="pBio">
		Pete grew up in Sayreville, NJ and graduated from Rutgers University in 1993 with a degree in Political Science.  After graduation,  Pete got the
		idea of opening up a dog salon with his then-girlfriend Martha, who worked as a hairstylist at Supercuts.  With Pete's savvy business skills and 
		Martha's willingness to switch to grooming cats & dogs instead of cutting human hair, the couple opened a pet grooming salon in the Fall of 1995,
		6 months after their marriage.  With close to 2 decades of experience and happy customers, Pete is grateful for the salon's success.

		<p id="mBio">
		Martha grew up in Old Bridge, NJ and graduated from Old Bridge High School in 1989.  An avid animal lover, Martha always wanted to groom cats and
		dogs, but settled on cutting people's hair because of her lack of finances to start her own business.  After marrying Pete, the couple were able 
		to save up enough money to start Pete's Pet Zone.  Although Martha does most of the grooming for the cats & dogs along with her helpers while 
		Pete handles the financials for PPZ, the salon was named after Pete because the couple agreed that PPZ has a nice ring to it and is easy to 
		remember.
